###  @ConfigurationProperties

@ConfigurationProperties allows the developer to map the entire content of the properties file to a POJO. A property file can be either application.properties or application.yml.
This annotation is useful when we have a large set of explicit configurations defined in the properties file. It provides an organized and Java-specific approach to defining the properties. We can cluster similar sets or properties to multiple POJOs.
It also supports binding an external property file to a Java Object.
